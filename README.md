REST API created for a parking. I created this using Java and Spring Boot framework

This projected is about a REST API to manage a parking. 

I did this with Java 18 + Spring Boot.
I add some dependecies to help me out on this one like:

Swagger is a great partnet to visualize and test the API. You can test it and see what comes next, what HTTP code is returning, if it's not what you're expecting, it's time to return to the code and fix it. Swagger gives us more confidence before we deploy our application
